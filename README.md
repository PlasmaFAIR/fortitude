# Fortitude

A Fortran linter, inspired by (and built upon) [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).
Written in Rust :crab: and installable with Python :snake:.

- :zap: Blazingly fast, up to hundreds of times faster than other open-source Fortran
  linters.
- :wrench: Automatically fixes linter warnings.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: 50+ rules, with many more planned.
- :page_with_curl: Multiple output formats, including SARIF and GitHub/GitLab CI.
- :handshake: Follows [community best
  practices](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/best_practices/).
- :muscle: Built on a robust [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)
  parser.

## Installation

Fortitude is available as
[`fortitude-lint`](https://pypi.org/project/fortitude-lint) on PyPI:

```bash
# With uv:
uv tool install fortitude-lint@latest

# With pip:
pip install fortitude-lint
```

Starting with version `0.7.0`, Fortitude can be installed with our
standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux:
curl -LsSf https://github.com/PlasmaFAIR/fortitude/releases/latest/download/fortitude-installer.sh | sh

# On Windows:
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/PlasmaFAIR/fortitude/releases/latest/download/fortitude-installer.psi | iex"
```

It can also be installed as a pure Rust project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlasmaFAIR/fortitude
cd fortitude
cargo install --path fortitude
```

Fortitude can also be installed via [other package managers](https://fortitude.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Usage

Fortitude can lint your whole project under the working directory
using the `check` command:

```bash
fortitude check
```

You can also call `check` on individual files, globs, and
directories. You can configure what extensions Fortitude searches
for in directories with `--file-extensions`:

```bash
fortitude check --file-extensions=f90,fpp
```

Be default, Fortitude will ignore files and directories in your `.gitignore`.
This can be disabled by setting `--no-respect-gitignore`. Additional excludes
can be set using `--excludes`:

```bash
# Don't check in the `benchmarks/` and `tests/` directories.
fortitude check --exclude=benchmarks,tests
```

You can select or ignore individual rules or whole groups with
`--select` and `--ignore`:

```bash
# Just check for missing `implicit none`
fortitude check --select=C001
# Also check for missing `implicit none` in interfaces
fortitude check --select=C001,C002
# Ignore all styling rules
fortitude check --ignore=S
# Only check for style rules, but ignore superfluous implicit none
fortitude check --select=S --ignore=S201
# Rules and categories can also be referred to by name
fortitude check --select=style --ignore=superfluous-implicit-none
```

Use `--output-format=concise` to get shorter output:

```bash
$ fortitude check --output-format=concise
test.f90:2:1: C111 function not contained within (sub)module or program
test.f90:5:1: S061 end statement should read 'end function double'
test.f90:7:1: C111 subroutine not contained within (sub)module or program
test.f90:8:3: C022 real has implicit kind
```

The `explain` command can be used to get extra information about any rules:

```bash
# Print extra information for all rules
fortitude explain
# Only get information for selected rules
fortitude explain C001 C011
# Print information on all style rules
fortitude explain S
# Rules and categories can also be referred to by name
fortitude explain obsolescent superfluous-implicit-none
```

To see further commands and optional arguments, try using `--help`:

```bash
fortitude --help
fortitude check --help
```

### Fixes

> [!NOTE]
> Added in v0.6.0

Fortitude can automatically fix some lint warnings, such as
unnecessary `implicit none` statements, missing double-colons in
variable declarations, and more. Just pass the `--fix` flag to
`check`:

```console
$ fortitude check --fix
fortitude: 1 files scanned.
Number of errors: 2 (2 fixed, 0 remaining)
```

Run `fortitude explain` to see which rules have fixes available.

### Preview

> [!NOTE]
> Added in v0.6.0

Some fortitude rules are only available through an opt-in preview
mode to give the community some time to evaluate them and provide
feedback. To enable preview rules, pass the `--preview` flag to
`check`,

```console
$ fortitude check --preview
```

or to enable more permanently, set it in your `fpm.toml`:

```toml
[extra.fortitude.check]
preview = true
```

or `fortitude.toml`:

```toml
[check]
preview = true
```

Run `fortitude explain` to see which rules are in preview mode.



## Configuration

Fortitude will look for either a `fortitude.toml` or `fpm.toml` file in the
current directory, or one of its parents. If using `fortitude.toml`, settings
should be under the command name:

```toml
[check]
select = ["C", "E", "S"]
ignore = ["S001", "S082"]
line-length = 132
```

For `fpm.toml` files, this has to be additionally nested under the
`extra.fortitude` table:

```toml
[extra.fortitude.check]
select = ["C", "E", "S"]
ignore = ["S001", "S082"]
line-length = 132
```

You can use `--extend-select` from the command line to select additional
rules on top of those in the configuration file.

```bash
# Select correctness, error, style and obsolescent categories
fortitude check --extend-select=OB
```
