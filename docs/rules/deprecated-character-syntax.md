# deprecated-character-syntax (OB061)
Fix is always available.

This rule is turned on by default.

## What does it do?
Checks for outdated declarations of `character*N`, `character*(*)`,
`character*(:)`, and `character*(integer-expression)`.

## Why is this bad?
The syntax `character*N` has been replaced by `character(len=N)` in modern
Fortran. Prefer the second form.
