# trailing-whitespace (S101)
Fix is always available.

This rule is turned on by default.

## What does it do?
Checks for tailing whitespace

## Why is this bad?
Trailing whitespace is difficult to spot, and as some editors will remove it
automatically while others leave it, it can cause unwanted 'diff noise' in
shared projects.
