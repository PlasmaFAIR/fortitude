# else-clause-missing-space (S231)
Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../preview.md). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does
Checks for the use of `elseif` instead of `else if` and `elsewhere` instead
of `else where`.

## Why is this bad?
TODO Needs a better explanation than "because I prefer it this way"
