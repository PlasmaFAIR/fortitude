# invalid-tab (PORT031)
Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../preview.md). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does
Checks for the use of tab characters as whitespace

## Why is this bad?
Tabs are not part of the Fortran standard, and compilers may
reject the source if using a strict conformance mode (for example,
`gfortran -std=f2023 -Werror`).
